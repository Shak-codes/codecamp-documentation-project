                <!-- Main takeaway -->
                <h3>All I'm going to say for advice on tweets is to
                    think before you tweet. Very often I will see a
                    tweet and simply wonder 'why was this made?' So 
                    I implore you all, before you tweet, think about
                    how you would feel if somebody you very much 
                    disliked tweeted the same thing.</a>

                <!-- Main takeaway -->
                <h3>The reasons for following another person is pretty simple.
                    You follow somebody because you like seeing their 
                    tweets, or maybe you identify with someone and so 
                    you decide to follow them. Regardless, you can 
                    practically follow anyone, and you'll probably 
                    find yourself following a large amount of people.
                    These people you follow will shape the media
                    that you see on twitter, so choose wisely.
                </h3>

                <!-- Who to follow -->
                <p>Some recommendations for people to follow</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>@FTWin_spl and their members</li>
                    <li>@Midifreeze</li>
                    <li>@_iceangel22_</li>
                    <li>@Duracell_DLC</li>
                    <li>@NitrogueYT</li>
                    <li>@rotomotorz</li>
                    <li>@ACID_100</li>
                    <li>@ACWOAE</li>
                    <li>@GitGudSam</li>
                    <li>@badatsplatoon</li>
                    <li>@BlueTakenoko</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are many more people I would recommend,
                    but for the sake of not creating a large list
                    I will leave you with those above.

                <header id="notification-bell">Notification Bell</header>
                
                <h3>You may not know, but Twitter has a notification
                    bell for its users. A good friend of mine, @gamaroo
                    typically responds to my tweets with 'noti gang.' For 
                    a while I was confused until I finally realized that 
                    Gamer is eluding to the fact that he is part of the 
                    'Notification gang.' Those that turn on the notification 
                    bell for an individual will receive notifications when 
                    that user tweets. I suggest you join the noti gang for 
                    users you're particularly fond of, to support them as best 
                    you can.

                <h3>The mute button is another extremely useful
                    feature on Twitter. We spoke about following 
                    users that you like, however, sometimes you 
                    may find individuals that you aren't very 
                    fond of. In some cases, these people find 
                    their way onto your twitter feeds one way 
                    or another. Perhaps it's their terrible 
                    opinions or just the way they present 
                    themself that rubs you the wrong way. Luckily,
                    the mute button ensures that you won't see
                    tweets from those individuals at all. Very 
                    useful to keep your peace of mind as Twitter 
                    can become almost a warzone at times.
                </h3>
                <h4>How to mute someone</h3>
                <p>Muting someone is simple! Just go to their page
                    hit the three dots and select mute and voila! 
                    You'll never see these tweets again.

                <header id="block">Block</header>
                
                <h3>Blocking someone is pretty similar to muting. 
                    This typically leads to the big question. 'Why
                    choose one over the other?' Well there is a bit
                    of a difference between blocking and muting. Blocking 
                    let's the targeted user know that they have been 
                    blocked, while muting does not provide the targeted 
                    individual any idea that they have been blocked.
                </h3>
                <h4>An example where you may block someone.</h3>

                    rude, or harmful towards other individuals, 
                    you may have to resort to reporting them.
                    Nobody likes someone that attacks others 
                    or puts them down and so the report button 
                    lets Twitter know exactly what that individual 
                    is doing so Twitter can take action. It's 
                    important to not abuse this button and only 
                    report individuals who are genuinely being 
                    problematic.
