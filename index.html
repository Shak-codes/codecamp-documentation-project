            <!-- Main takeaway -->
            <h2>All I'm going to say for advice on tweets is to
                think before you tweet. Very often I will see a
                tweet and simply wonder 'why was this made?' So 
                I implore you all, before you tweet, think about
                how you would feel if somebody you very much 
                disliked tweeted the same thing.></a>

            <h2>The act of following another person is pretty simple.
                You follow somebody because you like seeing their 
                tweets, or maybe you identify with someone and so 
                you decide to follow them. Regardless, you can 
                practically follow anyone, and you'll probably 
                find yourself following a large amount of people.
                The more the merrier!
